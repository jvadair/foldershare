# FolderShare
FolderShare is a simple way to share and receive files across the local network.

## How to use
Run the main.py file inside of the directory you want to share, then use the URL provided. That's it!

    You can also use the build.py file to create an executable that
    doesn't need python to run. This is also useful for creating a 
    binary that you can place in a directory on your PATH. The build.py
    file currently only supports Windows and Linux, but has only been 
    tested on Linux.
